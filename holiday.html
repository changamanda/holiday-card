    <p><strong>There is so much beauty in this world.</strong></p>
    <p>The holiday season is traditionally one filled with reflection and sentimentalism – so I will reflect, sentimentally. While 2014 was a year of aimless wandering, 2015 was rich with adventure, presentness, and purpose. For that, I am so grateful.</p>

    <p>A few weeks into 2015, I was hired for my first full-time job as a web development instructor at the Flatiron School. The experience spoiled me – every day, I got to teach some of the most inspired people I've ever met and I was constantly surrounded by reminders of how to keep perspective. One of my favorites is this gem from David Foster Wallace's speech <a href="https://vimeo.com/68855377"><em>This is Water</em></a>:</p>
    <p><blockquote>If you’re automatically sure that you know what reality is and who and what is really important — if you want to operate on your default-setting — then you, like me, will not consider possibilities that aren’t pointless and annoying. But if you’ve really learned how to think, how to pay attention, then you will know you have other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, loud, slow, consumer-hell-type situation as not only meaningful but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the stars — <strong>compassion, love, the sub-surface unity of all things</strong>.</blockquote></p>
    <p>As I reflect on this quote, and on this year, I can't help but think that I've managed to surround myself with people who embrace compassion, love, and the sub-surface unity of all things. The fact that you're receiving this means that you've had a positive impact on my year and contribute to the kind world that I want to live in – thank you. And please never hesitate to reach out if you need anything in 2016!</p>
    <p>Happy holidays!</p>
