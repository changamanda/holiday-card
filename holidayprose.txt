There is so much beauty in the world.

The holiday season is traditionally one filled with reflection and sentimentalism – so I will reflect, sentimentally. While 2014 was a year of aimless wandering, 2015 was rich with adventure, presentness, and purpose. For that, I am so grateful.

Like many, I can get tied up in current events, more focused on what needs improving than what is already wonderful. So in the spirit of the holidays, I'd like to document two stories of small kindnesses that represent the aspects of the world that I love.

In mid-October, I played in a frisbee tournament called Celebración with a team called Pad See Ew. The one-day tournament was my first time meeting most of my teammates.

At the start of the tournament, one team member was dressed as a zombie. The rest of us were dressed as villagers, and as we scored off of a throw from a zombie, we got zombie-fied.

I'd been playing ultimate for about half a year at that point, and the last team sport I played was softball in fifth grade – so inevitably I watched as half, three-quarters, then every other member of the team became a zombie. It wasn't my day, and I was exhausted. But rather than give up on this stranger they'd never met before, the team put in extra effort to set me up for a score, which finally happened in the middle of the third game. The gesture was incredible, and I won't forget it.
